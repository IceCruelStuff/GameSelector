# GAME SELECTOR

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
thanks to this plugin you can add a creature to the crate. clicking that opens the chest of the creature and living things. My goal: to be able to look the outdoor games by adding it within the objects commands to it from here. Like MinePlex

Sorry, bad english :D

Commands:
- /gs add
- /gs additem
- /gs removeitem
- /gs setcommand (not work now)
- /gs setname

How to use this plugin?
1. first, write this command "/gs add <name>"
2. then touch the a entity(player, slapper, mobs...)
3.and now you created a entity's inventory, click the entity and open the entity inventory
4.You can add and remove item in the entity's inventory(/gs additem <selectorname> <itemid> <damage> <count> , /gs removeitem <selectorname> <itemid> <damage> <count>)
5.You can change the entity's inventory name(/gs setname <selectorname> <newname>
6.You can add command the items(not work now)
